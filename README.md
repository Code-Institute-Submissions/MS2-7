# CrestTest: A fun football quiz

For my Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project I have decided to create a football quiz named CrestTest that's fun and intuative to play, and hopefully provides an enjoyable user experience that encourages repeat play.

The aim of the game is to identify the football team from the crest displayed, and then select the league that that team plays in from the 4 options displayed.

## UX
 
I was inspired to create CrestTest from the great number and popularity of other football related quizes available that are enjoyed by the millions of people with an interest in football.  CrestTest's appealing aesthetics, very simple premise and deceptively challenging questions combine to give an enjoyable user experience.  Taking advantage of the competetive nature within all football fans, CrestTest will have the user playing again and again with the aim of reaching the end before losing all of their 3 lives (with the questions getting progressively harder this is no easy challenge!).

I took a Mobile-First approach to developing CrestTest but the game is equally enjoyable when played on all devices and screen sizes.
