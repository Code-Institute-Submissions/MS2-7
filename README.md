# CrestTest: A fun football quiz

For my Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project I have decided to create a football quiz named CrestTest that's fun and intuative to play, and hopefully provides an enjoyable user experience that encourages repeat play.

The aim of the game is to identify the football team from the crest displayed, and then select the league that that team plays in from the 4 options displayed.

## UX
 
I was inspired to create CrestTest from the great number and popularity of other football related quizes available that are enjoyed by the millions of people with an interest in football.  CrestTest's appealing aesthetics, very simple premise and deceptively challenging questions combine to give an enjoyable user experience.  Taking advantage of the competetive nature within all football fans, CrestTest will have the user playing again and again with the aim of reaching the end before losing all of their 3 lives (with the questions getting progressively harder this is no easy challenge!).

I took a Mobile-First approach to developing CrestTest but the game is equally enjoyable when played on all devices and screen sizes. 

### User Stories

- As a user, I want the opening page to look great and inspire me to press Start.
- As a user, I want the rules of the game to be simple and clearly explained to me so that I can get straight to playing.
- As a user, I want navigation and use to be simple and intuative.
- As a user, I want the questions to be challenging yet not too hard
- As a user, I want to be presented with my final score so that I can attempt to beat it or perhaps challenge a friend to beat it 

### Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to design some wireframes which can be seen [here](https://github.com/JimEv87/MS2/tree/master/wireframes)

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Home Page

- The home page features the CrestTest logo as a heading, a brief quide on how to play, and a start button.
- A visually pleasing background image of a football stadium that continuously scrolls slowly from side to side 

#### Quiz Page

- Three footballs at the top of the page to indicate lives remaining, they turn red one by one at every wrong answer.
- A large clear image of a football team's crest centre screen, with 4 answer options beneath for the user to guess which league that team plays in.
- Once a selection has been made, the correct answer is shown and a Next button appears for the user to progress to the next question.
- The running score of total correct answers is shown at the bottom of the screen
